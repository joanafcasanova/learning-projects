## Introduction
Payments are a fundamental source of information for banks as well as a critical source of revenue and recurring business. For financial institutions, maintaining a transactional relationship with their customers is essential. Payments serve as the cornerstone of a primary banking relationship, creating opportunities to expand the relationship to other types of financial products.

For individual customers, components such as credit turnover, direct debits, and the use of debit or credit cards are key to ensuring a primary relationship. Similarly, for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals become a crucial element in facilitating payments and ensuring these transactions are intermediated by the bank. POS terminals not only reinforce strong relationships with SME customers but also act as a significant source of valuable information and additional services for these businesses.

The CRM team plays a vital role in enhancing the sales process by refining the selection of customers for targeted commercial outreach. Given that sales teams often have limited capacity for customer interactions, prioritizing contacts based on the expected likelihood of success or return becomes a critical task.

## The Objective
In this business case, the task is to support a sales team in identifying SME customers with the highest propensity to sign up for a POS terminal. The project focuses on optimizing the efficiency of a marketing campaign that offers a limited-time, high-value proposition. By accurately identifying and prioritizing high-potential customers, the salesforce can maximize the campaign's impact despite constrained resources.

To achieve this, a dataset has been provided containing anonymized and sanitized data from real SME customers. The dataset includes information about various SMEs, including a subset that adopted a POS terminal within three months of a specific point in time.

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that identifies SMEs most likely to adopt a POS terminal in the coming weeks. This model will allow the sales team to prioritize their outreach and maximize the number of successful sales, ensuring an effective and focused use of resources.
